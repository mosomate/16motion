# 16Motion
Configurable, 3D printable carriage for aluminium extrusions. A 16Motion carriage consists of four 3D printed plates put together around the extrusion and some **cheap**, **easily sourceable** hardwares including 684 bearings, M3 and M4 screws and nuts.

# Disclaimer
As steel bearings are rolling on aluminium, they might leave marks and/or wear out the extrusion over time. For **casual** usage it's not significant, but for **regular** usage you should consider using lubrication (ex. a thin layer of lithium grease should do the job).

This design is sensitive for dirt building up on the extrusion. Wiping them clean before usage is recommended!

If you can accept these conditions, then have fun building your carriages!
# BOM for one plate
For one of the four plates you need:
- 3D printed plate **x1**
- 3D printer bearing spacer **x4**
- M4x(width of extrusion + 10 mm) screw **x2** *(ex. if the extrusion is 20 mm width, screw length will be 20 mm + 10 mm = 30 mm)*
- M3x16 screw **x2**
- M3 self-locking nut **x2**
- 684 bearing **x4**
