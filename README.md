# 16Motion
Configurable, 3D printable carriage for aluminium extrusions. A 16Motion carriage consists of four 3D printed plates put together around the extrusion and some **cheap**, **easily sourceable** hardwares including 684 bearings, M3 and M4 screws and nuts.
![16Motion main cover](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mosomate/16motion/main/docs/cover.png)
Each plate has 8 attachment points to mount tools and accessories to the carriage using M3 screws and nuts. These 8 points split up to 2 groups: 4 **plate attachment point**s (indicated by yellow arrows) and 4 **carriage attachment point**s (indicated by violet arrows).

**Carriage attachment points** go through at least 2 plates, therefore they give additional stuctural rigidity to the carriage. If you use only **plate attachment points**, it is recommended to put an M3x16 screw into a few of the **carriage attachment points** as well.
Horizontal distance between the points is fixed at 23 mm and the vertical can be calculated with this formula: *vertical_distance = (extrusion_width + 9 mm) / 2*
# Disclaimer
As steel bearings are rolling on aluminium, they might leave marks and/or wear out the extrusion over time. For **casual** usage it's not significant, but for **regular** usage you should consider using lubrication (ex. a thin layer of lithium grease should do the job).

This design is sensitive for dirt building up on the extrusion. Wiping them clean before usage is recommended!

If you can accept these conditions, then have fun building your carriages!
# BOM for one plate
For one of the four plates you need:
- 3D printed plate **x1**
- 3D printer bearing spacer **x4**
- M4x(width of extrusion + 10 mm) screw **x2** *(e.g. if the extrusion is 20 mm width, screw length will be 20 mm + 10 mm = 30 mm)*
- M3x16 screw **x2**
- M3 self-locking nut **x2**
- 684 bearing **x4**
# Precompiled STLs
I uploaded precompiled STLs to Thingiverse for **20 mm**, **25 mm** and **40 mm** wide extrusions. Check them out [HERE](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6853255). If you can't find the suitable sizes to satisfy your needs, then proceed with the customization.
# Customization and assembly
You can find here the necessary steps for customizing the plates and assembling the carriage. Each step has a video tutorial of it, click on the banner to watch them on YouTube!
## Plate customization
- Open **FreeCAD** and open **Plate.FCStd**
- If you see nothing but the model of a ring (spacer) you have to toggle the visibility of the plate. Right click on **Plate** object and select **Appearance...**. Then open the dropdown at **Document window** and select **Flat Lines** again
- Right click on the **Plate** document and check **Skip recomputes**
- Click on **Spreadsheet** and edit the **Ideal extrusion width** and **Actual extrusion width** parameters. **Ideal extrusion width** is the theoretical width of one side of the extrusion (e.g. 20 mm) and the **Actual extrusion width** is the masured size of it (e.g. 19.9 mm). For maximum accuracy I recommend using a caliper for measuring
- Right click on **Spreadsheet** and select **Recompute object**
- Recompute all remaining objects as well (Plate, Spacer and Assets)
- Select **Mesh** from the Workbench selector
- Select **Plate** object by clicking on it and click on **Create mesh from shape...** button. My preferred settings for mesh creation are: **Surface deviation => 0.1 mm** and **Angular deviation => 5.00 Ëš**
- Create mesh from the **Spacer** object as well
- Export meshes by right click on them and select **Export mesh...**

## Plate assembly
- After 3D printing, drill an M4 thread into the **bottom left** and **top right** holes
- Insert an **M3 self locking nut** into the socket below one of the preload levers
- Insert an **M3x16** screw through the preload lever and drive it until it barely touches the lever
- Repeat the step above for the other lever

## Carriage assembly
After you got your four plates printed and assembled, proceed with assemling the carriage. Additinal materials:
- 16 pcs of 3D printed spacers
- 16 pcs of 684 bearings
- 8 pcs of M4 screws with the length discussed in **BOM for one plate** section

Assembly:
- Put together the four plates. For this step it's nice to have long M3 screws or Allen wrenches poked through carriage attachment points
- Screw in one M4 screw into the threaded hole of a plate until it reaches the other side of the plate
- Put a spacer and a bearing in the route of the M4 screw
- Drive the screw until it can hold the spacer and the bearing
- Put an other pair of spacer and bearing in the route of the M4 screw and drive it all the way in
- Tighten the M4 screw firmly
- Repeat these steps for the remaining 7 positions around the carriage
- Remove the things you used to hold the plates together

## Preload settings
Here comes the tricky part. One rule: *No play, no too much tension!* Try to pay attension for having roughly the same tension for one pair of preload levers as you can see here:

![Preload comparison](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mosomate/16motion/main/docs/preload_comparison.png)

My best practice to set the correct amount preload:
- Get a piece of the extrusion the carriage made was made for
- Sand down the edges on one end of the extrusion
- Slide the carriage onto the extrusion and place the extrusion on a flat surface vertically
- Start tightening the screws of one pair of the preload levers in small increments
- Check if you can feel any resistance when sliding off and on the carriage again
- Stop tightening the screws if you can feel a slight resistance when sliding the carriage onto the extrusion
- Repeat this process for the rest of the preload levers

Important notes: 
- The carriage should fall through the extrusion by it's own weight when stands vertically. If it's stuck, you applied too much preload
- I hope the video describes the process well
